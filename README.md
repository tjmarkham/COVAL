# COVAL - COVID-19 Vaccine Appointment Locator

** **Pennsylvania Rite Aid Stores ONLY** **

Most pharmacies (e.g. CVS) will tell you where COVID-19 vaccine appointments are available.

However, Rite Aid's website design means you have to check each store individually to find available appointments. This is quite burdensome.

The goal of this program is to take the guesswork out of finding a COVID-19 vaccine appointment at Rite Aid in Pennsylvania.
